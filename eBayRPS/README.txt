Built using Java 7 on OSX.

Running instructions:

A runnable copy of the jar is in the root folder and can be started by running

java -jar eBayRPS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

alternatively you can run a build in from the project root:

mvn clean install

which will create a new runnable jar in the /target folder.
